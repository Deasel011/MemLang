MemLang is a language to make Memory Sniffing and Editing easy in any game.
It tracks memory value with the use of narrowing functions until it finds
the desired set of addresses. From there, it is then possible to set the values
to what ever the user wants to.

As of now, most of the effort (20hours+) has been devoted to setting up a working
Java Native Access interface with Windows OS. The language can do basic functions
like declaring address variables for 4-bytes numbers and narrowing down on them.

In the near future, String support will be added as well as a complete real-time
Interpretor to run MemLang. Executing commands on defined addresses should also
be right around the corner. As time progresses, more granular memory tasks will
make their way into MemLang.
